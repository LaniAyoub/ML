Exploratory Data Analysis
Objective:
Understand our data as well as possible (a small step forward is better than a big step backward)
Develop an initial modeling strategy

Basic Checklist
Shape Analysis:
Target variable: Churn
Rows and columns: 7043, 21
Types of variables: qualitative: 17, quantitative: 4
Missing values analysis:
there are NaNs apaired because of changing of datatype of TotalCharges

Content Analysis:
Target visualization:
73% NO (5174 / 7043)
26% NO (1869 / 7043)

Meaning of variables:
Continuous variables : MonthlyCharges,TotalCharges, tenure , SeniorCitizen( 83% 0,16% 1)
Qualitative variable: binary, there some dependes on each others  (
    -MultipleLines depends on PhoneService
    -OnlineSecurity dependes on InternetService
    -DeviceProtection dependes on InternetService
    -TechSupport dependes on InternetService
    -StreamingTV dependes on InternetService
    -StreamingMovies dependes on InternetService
)

Variable / Target Relations:
Target / Charges: there are no relations between the charges and the churn
Target / age:  the age dosn't affect the churn 
Target / tenure: the client with more tenure is more likelly to not churn
Target / Qualitative: 
 - gender dosn't effect the churn
 - customers without partoner  are more likely to churn
 - customers without dependneces  are more likely to churn
 - customers without phoneService are less likely to churn
 - the MultipleLines dosn't effect the churn
 - the internet service FiberOptic is more likely to churn
 - the client without online security are more likely to churn
 - the client without backup service are more likely to churn
 - the client wihout deviceProtection are more likely to churn
 - the client wihout techsuport are more likely to churn
 - the StreamingTV don't affect the churn 
 - the StreamingMovies don't affect the churn
 - the clients with month-to-month contract are more likely to churn
 - the client with parperlessBilling are more likely to churn
 - the client with electronic check as payment method are more likely to churn

More Detailed Analysis
Variable / Variable Relations:
count data / count data: there are no relation between the continus columns
tenure data / count data: very weak correlation between tenure and count values
InternetService /StreamingMovies,StreamingTV,TechSupport,DeviceProtection,OnlineSecurity :a high relation of no InternetService there are no service related on it at all
Disease / blood data relation: Blood rates differ between sick and covid-19 patients
Hospitalization / disease relation:
Hospitalization / blood relation: interesting for predicting which patient service to assign to

NaN analysis:
Viral: 1350 (92/8), blood: 600 (87/13), both: 90

Null hypotheses (H0):
Individuals with covid-19 have significantly different Leukocytes, Monocytes, Platelets rates
H0 = The mean rates are EQUAL for positive and negative individuals
Individuals with any disease have significantly different rates
